# Overview of Data Lakehouse and NoSQL Database Management Systems
## INTRODUCTION
This summary discusses two papers, "A Comparison of NoSQL Database Management Systems and Models" and "Data Lakehouse." The two cited articles discuss data management and analytics in the context of contemporary database architectures and systems. Both papers touch about data management in general and how technologies and methods are changing.

## NoSQL Database Management Systems
The article benefits the learners about different types of NoSQL database types. From this, the readers can easily choose right database for their projects.

The article fully examines NoSQL database management systems and its many models, highlighting their relevance in modern data management owing to their adaptability and scalability. To meet different data management requirements, it divides NoSQL databases into key-value stores, document-oriented databases, column-family stores, and graph databases.

Key-value stores, like Redis and Riak, are rapid and simple to use, making them perfect for session management and caching. Document-oriented databases like MongoDB, which also offer scalability and adaptable schemas, are particularly well-suited to semi-structured data.The distributed design and high availability of column-family stores, like Apache Cassandra, make them ideal for large-scale data applications. Social networks and recommendation systems are ideal applications for graph databases with a focus on relationship-heavy data models, such as Neo4j.

## Data Lakehouse

In this article, the concept of data warehouses and data lakes are combined and this is known as DATA LAKEHOUSE. This provides efficient data storage and analytics. The Data Lakehouse architecture is designed to store raw data in its original format while still giving organized and high-performance access to it. The Data Lakehouse aims to simplify data architecture, remove data silos, and improve data analytics operation

Data lake house helps in management of data sets and deriving values from different data sets. It has the both the features of data lakes and data warehouse thus providing scalability, cost effectiveness, data governance and query performance.By utilizing both structured and unstructured data sources, organizations may uncover hidden trends and make accurate choices based on a thorough knowledge of their data.
